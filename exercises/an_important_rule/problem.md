# There's always a catchâ€¦ (lol pun)

Promises are designed to emulate synchronous control flows.
If any of them throw an exception, the exception will bubble up
through the stack until it is caught by a catch block or
hits the global context where it will be thrown.

In the code below, each expression is evaluated one after the
other.  If any expression throws an exception, **all subsequent
expressions will not be executed** and the catch block
will catch and handle it.

```js
try {
  doStuff()
  doMoreStuff()
} catch (err) {
  complainAboutJavascript(err);
}
```

With promises, we can achieve a very similar control flow as shown
(assume all functions return promises):

```js
doStuff()
.then(doMoreStuff)
.then(null, complainAboutJavascript);
```

Maybe we should combine the last two lines since one is a fulfill
handler and the other is a rejection handler?  **NO!**  While this
might initially seem sensible consider what would happen if
`doMoreStuff` threw an error.  Since the promise returned from it
would be rejected, it would look for the **next** rejection handler
to handle it.

Remember: A promise can **never** resolve more than once.

It is, therefore, a best practice to always put a rejection handler
at the bottom of your promise chain (much like a catch block).

It is worth pointing out that both the synchronous **and** asynchronous
code have the same problem.  If the rejection handler itself throws
an error you are going to have a bad time.

Many promise libraries try to ameliorate this problem for you
by providing a `done` handler that simple handles any uncaught
errors.  The rule of thumb is this:

> If you are **not** returning a value from your promise to a caller,
> then attach a `done` handler to guard against uncaught exceptions.

An example is shown below:

```js
doStuff()
.then(doMoreStuff)
.then(null, complainAboutJavascript)
.done();
```

## Task

We are going to demonstrate this to ourselves by creating a chain
of functions that **all** print to the console.

1. Create a function `throwMyGod` that throws an `Error` with
   text `"OH NOES"`;
2. Create a function `iterate` that prints the first argument
   (an integer) to it and then returns that argument + 1;
3. Create a promise chain that wraps your iterate method using Q's
   `fcall` then a series of iterations that attempts to perform `iterate`
   a total of 10 times.
4. Attach `console.log` as a rejection handler at the bottom of your
   chain.
5. Insert a call to `throwMyGod` after your 5th call of `iterate`

If you have done this correctly, your code should print 1,2,3,4,5,
"[Error: OH NOES]".  It's important to notice that the thrown exception was
turned into a rejected promise which caused the rejected promise to
travel down the promise chain to the first available rejection handler.

## Bonus

Try swapping your rejection handler from `console.log` to `throwMyGod`.
Your program will now throw an exception in the global context!  Ahh!
Try to fix this using the approach described above.
