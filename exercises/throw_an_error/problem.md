# What happens when an error is thrown?

One of the tremendous strengths of promises is that they handle errors in a
manner similar to synchronous code.  Unlike in traditional callback-based code,
you do not need to strictly handle all your errors at every step.

If an error is thrown inside a function, it can be captured.

If an error is thrown inside a function, it will be handled by the next
available *"rejection"* handler.  This allows you to write code that looks
remarkably like a `try`/`catch` block would in synchronous code.

```js
try {
  doSomethingRisky();
  doAnotherRiskyThing();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

The equivalent "promisified" code might look like:

```js
doSomethingRisky()
.then(doAnotherRiskyThing)
.then(null, console.log);
```

## Task

Let's build exactly the system discussed above.

Some invalid JSON will be available on `process.argv[2]`.

1. Build a function called `parsePromised` that creates a promise,
   performs `JSON.parse` in a `try`/`catch` block, and resolves or rejects
   the promise depending on whether an error is thrown.
   **Note:** your function should synchronously return the promise!
2. Build a sequence of steps like the ones shown above that catches
   any thrown errors and logs them to the console.
