# Using Q's `fcall` to simplify our code

Wrapping a value or synchronous function call in a promise is a
fairly easy pattern to capture in a generic way.

The `q` library has a function for just this purpose called `fcall`.

## Task

Use `fcall` to replace the entire `parsePromised` function from the previous
lesson.
