{bold}What happens if we reject AND resolve a promise?{/bold}

The Promises/A+ spec states that a promise, once fullfilled or
rejected, may NOT change states for the rest of its lifetime.  This is 
an important feature of promises and it is also one of the things
that differentiates it from an EventEmitter (and other forms of repeatable 
callbacks);

Callback-style code usually requires a callback function to be invoked
somewhere in the body of the function that it was passed to.  Many, if not
most times, that function is intended to be called only once.  However, through
errors in logic, problems with syntax, or other simple mistakes it is
possible to call your callback multiple times and create vexxing states in your
app or insidious bugs.

/*
  this code is bad, but nonetheless common and has the nasty result of calling
  the supplied callback more than once (possibly destroying the earth?)
  it is conventional to return the first invocation of callback but it's 
  easy to overlook!
*/
var function (user, callback) {
  if (user) {
    callback(null, user); 
  }
  return callback("No user was found", null);
}

{bold}Task{/bold}

Let's build a simple script to PROVE to ourselves that promises may only resolve
one time and all future attempts to resolve them will simply be ignored.

1. Create a promise using Q.defer
2. Pass console.log as the first AND second argument to your promise's "then" method
3. Resolve the promise with a value of "I FIRED"
4. Reject the promise with a value of "I DID NOT FIRE"

If successful, your script should only log "I FIRED" and should NOT log 
"I DID NOT FIRE".
