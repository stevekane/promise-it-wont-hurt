{bold}What happens when an error is thrown?{/bold}

One of the tremendous strengths of promises is that they handle errors in a
manner similar to synchronous code.  Unlike in traditional callback-based code,
you do not need to strictly handle all your errors at every step.  

If an error is thrown inside a function, it can be captured

If an error is thrown inside a function, it will be handled by the next available
"rejection" handler.  This allows you to write code that looks remarkably like a 
"try/catch" block would in synchronous code.

try {
  doSomethingRisky();
  doAnotherRiskyThing();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}

The equivalent "promisified" code might look like:
doSomethingRisky()
.then(doAnotherRiskyThing)
.then(null, console.log);

Let's build exactly the system discussed above.  
Some invalid JSON will be available on process.argv[2];

1. Build a function called parsePromised that creates a promise,
   performs JSON.parse in a try/catch block, and resolves or rejects
   the promise depending on whether an error is thrown.
   **NOTE** your function should synchronously return the promise!
2. Build a sequence of steps like the ones shown above that catches
   any thrown errors and logs them to the console.
