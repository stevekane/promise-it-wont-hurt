{bold}Let's do several operations against "remote" machines{/bold}

Sending and fetching data from computers/processes other than your 
application is an increasingly common task in the world of node.js
and the browser.  Many times, you will need to gather data from 
several sources, perform operations on it, and send some data back out.

{bold}Task{/bold}

Let's talk to two remote processes over HTTP being run by your friend
and mine, "localhost"

Port 7000: Faux session cache (redis or some such thing) 
Port 7001: Faux database (mongo, level, postgres etc)

As in the previous lesson, use the "q-io" module to create promises
as wrappers for HTTP responses.  HINT: You will probably need more than
one promise...

1. Send an HTTP GET request to the session cache on port 7000.  A string
   will be returned to you representing a user id.
2. Grab that id from the session response and send an HTTP GET request to 
   your database on port 7001 to the url "localhost:7001/<id>".
3. If successfully done, your database will return a user object.  console.log 
   it to win many nerd-points.
