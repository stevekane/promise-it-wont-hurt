Rejecting a Promise

When a promise is rejected, this is typically (though not always) used to
indicate that a value was not successfully obtained by the promise.  Once 
a promise has been rejected, it can never be resolved (nor rejected again).

Promises implement internal state machines that have strict rules against
ever leaving either the resolved or rejected states.

{bold}Task{/bold}
User "q" again to create a promise

Create a function to print error.message using console.log.  Pass this 
function as a rejection handler to the "then" method of your promise.

Manually reject that promise using setTimeout with a delay of 300ms and pass it
an Error object with parameter "REJECTED!";

  var q = require('q');
  var defer = q.defer();
