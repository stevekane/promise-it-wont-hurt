{bold}What is a promise?{/bold}

A promise is an object that defines a method called "then".
The promise object represents a value (or values) that may
be available some time in the future.  

When a promise is resolved, any "success functions" registered 
with the "then" method will be called with the newly available data as arguments.  

If a promise is rejected then any "failure functions" registered 
with the "then" method will be called with the Error as argument.

For now, do not be concerned with exactly HOW this works or what the syntax is.
We are about to dive into that in detail

{bold}Setup{/bold}

To do many of the lessons in this workshop, you will need to install the "q" module.
To do this, type the following in your project's directory:

npm install q --save

This will install a local copy of the "q" module into your directory which you can
import into the file you have written using:

var q = require('q');

{bold}Task{/bold}

Use the popular "Q" library to create a promise.  

Pass console.log to the "then" method of your promise.

Manually resolve that promise using setTimeout with a delay of 300ms and pass
it a parameter of "RESOLVED!".

In Q, promises are created using Q.defer();

The defer that is created is not exactly the promise and in order to return the actual
promise object itself you must return the "promise" attribute of the newly created defer.

{bold}Boilerplate{/bold}

  var q = require('q');
  var defer = q.defer(); 
  //defer.promise is the actual promise itself
  //defer.promise.then is the "Q" way of attaching a then handler
  //your solution here
